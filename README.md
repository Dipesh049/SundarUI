# Features üëç

- Comprehensive component library: Sundar UI should offer a wide range of pre-built components for both Tailwind CSS and mobile applications. These components covers common UI elements such as buttons, forms, navigation and more.

- Customization options: While the pre-built components should be useful as is, users may want to customize them to better suit their specific needs. Sundar UI could provide customization options such as color schemes and more, so users can make the components their own.

- Code snippets: Many users will likely want to use Sundar UI components as part of their existing projects. Sundar UI provides code snippets for each component, making it easy for users to drop them into their codebase.

- Documentation: Clear documentation is key to using any new library or framework effectively. Sundar UI provides clear and concise documentation for each component, including examples of how they can be used and customized.

- Responsive design: Given the increasing importance of mobile devices, Sundar UI ensure that all components are fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

- Support for multiple libraries: While Tailwind CSS and XML/XSL, Sundar UI is also useful to support other popular libraries such as React.js, Vue.js along with that normal HTML5.
